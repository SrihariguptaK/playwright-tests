User navigates to the login page\n2. User locates the username input field\n3. User enters their username\n4. System validates that the field is not empty\n5. User proceeds to enter password\n6. User submits the login form\n\nTECHNICAL CONSIDERATIONS:\n• Data source: Frontend form input\n• Validation rules: Non-empty, no special characters\n• API endpoints: N/A for input\n• Security: Input sanitization to prevent injection\n• Performance: Instant client-side validation\n\nOUT OF SCOPE:\n• Password input and validation\n• Backend authentication processing\n\nSUCCESS METRICS:\n• 100% of login forms display username input\n• 95% reduction in empty username submissions\n• Accessibility compliance with WCAG 2.1 standards",
