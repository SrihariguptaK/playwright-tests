## Story: As Underwriting Analyst, I want to track the status of automated questions to achieve timely responses and application progression
**Story ID:** story-24

### Test Case: Verify question status dashboard functionality
- **ID:** tc-003
- **Type:** happy-path
- **Priority:** High
- **Estimated Time:** 10 mins

**Preconditions:**
- User has valid Underwriting Analyst credentials

- Question status dashboard is accessible
- API endpoint GET /api/questions/status is operational
- Multiple questions are assigned to the analyst with different priorities and statuses

| 1 | Log in to the system using valid Underwriting Analyst credentials | Analyst successfully authenticates and is redirected to the main dashboard or home page |
| 2 | Navigate to the question status dashboard from the main menu or navigation panel | Question status dashboard loads successfully within 1 second displaying the dashboard interface |
| 3 | Verify that all assigned questions are displayed with their current status | Dashboard displays a comprehensive list of all questions assigned to the analyst showing question ID, application reference, question text, status (Pending/Answered/Overdue), priority, and timestamp |
| 4 | Check that the dashboard shows real-time status information including counts for each status category | Dashboard header or summary section displays accurate counts: total questions, pending questions, answered questions, and overdue questions matching the detailed list |
| 5 | Apply a filter to show only 'Pending' status questions using the status filter dropdown | Dashboard refreshes and displays only questions with 'Pending' status, other status questions are hidden, filter indicator shows active filter |
| 6 | Clear the status filter and apply a priority filter to show only 'High' priority questions | Dashboard displays only high priority questions regardless of status, questions are filtered correctly based on priority level |
| 7 | Apply sorting by clicking on the 'Status' column header | Questions are sorted alphabetically by status (Answered, Overdue, Pending) in ascending order, sort indicator appears on the column header |
| 8 | Click the 'Status' column header again to reverse the sort order | Questions are sorted in descending order by status (Pending, Overdue, Answered), sort indicator changes to show descending order |

| 10 | Combine filters by selecting 'Overdue' status and 'High' priority simultaneously | Dashboard displays only questions that are both overdue AND high priority, showing correct intersection of filter criteria |
| 11 | Wait for the scheduled time when an overdue reminder should be triggered (or simulate time passage if testing environment allows) | Automated reminder notification is received for overdue questions via notification system, displaying alert with overdue question details |
| 12 | Verify the reminder notification content and delivery method | Reminder includes question details, application reference, days overdue, and priority level; notification appears in notification panel and/or email based on configuration |
| 13 | Clear all filters and verify dashboard returns to showing all questions | All assigned questions are displayed again with all statuses and priorities visible, filter indicators are cleared |
