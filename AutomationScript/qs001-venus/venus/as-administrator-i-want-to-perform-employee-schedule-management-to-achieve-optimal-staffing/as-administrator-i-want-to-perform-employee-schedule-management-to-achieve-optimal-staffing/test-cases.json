This feature allows administrators to assign employees to shifts based on the created templates.\n\nCURRENT STATE:\nCurrently, shifts are assigned manually, leading to potential conflicts and inefficiencies.\n\nDESIRED STATE:\nAdministrators can easily assign employees to shifts and view schedules in a user-friendly format.\n\nKEY FUNCTIONALITY:\n• Assign employees to shifts using templates.\n• View schedules in a calendar format.\n• Make adjustments to assignments as needed.\n• Employees can view their shifts in real-time.\n\nUSER INTERACTION FLOW:\n1. Administrator navigates to the employee schedule management page.\n2. Administrator selects a shift template.\n3. Administrator assigns employees to the selected shift.\n4. Administrator saves the schedule.\n5. System confirms the schedule update.\n6. Employees can view their assigned shifts.\n\nTECHNICAL CONSIDERATIONS:\n• Data source: EmployeeSchedules table in the database.\n• Validation rules: Ensure employees are not double-booked.\n• API endpoints: POST /api/employee-schedules for assignments.\n• Security: Only authorized administrators can manage schedules.\n• Performance: System should handle up to 500 employee assignments without performance issues.\n\nOUT OF SCOPE:\n• Employee self-service scheduling is not included in this story.\n\nSUCCESS METRICS:\n• 95% of shifts are filled without conflicts.",
