Administrator navigates to the role management section.\n2. Administrator selects the option to create a new role.\n3. Administrator inputs role name and assigns permissions.\n4. Administrator submits the role creation form.\n5. System validates the input and creates the role.\n6. Confirmation message is displayed.\n\nTECHNICAL CONSIDERATIONS:\n• Data source: Roles table in the database.\n• Validation rules: Ensure role names are unique.\n• API endpoints: POST /api/roles for role creation.\n• Security: Role management actions require admin authentication.\n• Performance: Role creation should complete within 2 seconds.\n\nOUT OF SCOPE:\n• Role assignment to users.\n\nSUCCESS METRICS:\n• 90% of roles created without errors within the first month. </div><br><div><strong>Persona:</strong> Administrator (Administrator) </div>",
