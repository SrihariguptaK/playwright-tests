    "description": "CONTEXT & BACKGROUND:\nThe ability to create shift templates is essential for streamlining the scheduling process. This feature allows administrators to define shifts that can be reused, reducing the time spent on scheduling.\n\nCURRENT STATE:\nCurrently, scheduling is done manually without templates, leading to inconsistencies and increased workload.\n\nDESIRED STATE:\nAdministrators can create and manage templates, ensuring consistency and efficiency in scheduling.\n\nKEY FUNCTIONALITY:\n• Create new shift templates with start and end times.\n• Define break times within templates.\n• Edit existing templates as needed.\n• Delete templates that are no longer in use.\n\nUSER INTERACTION FLOW:\n1. Administrator navigates to the shift template management page.\n2. Administrator clicks on 'Create New Template'.\n3. Administrator inputs shift details (start time, end time, breaks).\n4. Administrator saves the template.\n5. System confirms template creation.\n6. Administrator can view the list of created templates.\n\nTECHNICAL CONSIDERATIONS:\n• Data source: ShiftTemplates table in the database.\n• Validation rules: Ensure start time is before end time.\n• API endpoints: POST /api/shift-templates for creation.\n• Security: Only authorized administrators can create templates.\n• Performance: System should handle up to 100 templates without performance degradation.\n\nOUT OF SCOPE:\n• Employee-specific scheduling is not included in this story.\n\nSUCCESS METRICS:\n• 90% of templates created without errors.",
